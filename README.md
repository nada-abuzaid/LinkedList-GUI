Implement the following on the `SinglyLinkedList.prototype`

- [x] **Push**

This function should add a node to the end of the SinglyLinkedList. It should return the list so that the method can be chained.

- [x] **Pop**

This function should remove a node at the end of the SinglyLinkedList. It should return the node removed.

- [x] **Unshift**

This function should add a node to the beginning of the SinglyLinkedList. It should return the list so that the method can be chained.

- [x] **Shift**

This function should remove a node at the beginning of the SinglyLinkedList. It should return the node removed.

- [ ] **Set**

This function should update the value of a node at a given index of the SinglyLinkedList. It should return true if the node is updated successfully, or false if an invalid index is passed in.

- [x] **\_get**

This internal/helper function should find a node at a specified index in a SinglyLinkedList. It should return the found node.

- [ ] **\_insert**

This internal/helper function should insert a node at a specified index in a SinglyLinkedList. It should return the new length of the SinglyLinkedList.

- [x] **Remove**

This function should remove a node at a specified index in a SinglyLinkedList. It should return the removed node.

- [] **Reverse**

This function should reverse all of the nodes in a SinglyLinkedList. It should return the reversed SinglyLinkedList.

- [x] **Clear**

This function should delete all of the nodes in a SinglyLinkedList.
